4. Construct a matrix as follows. Set

B = eye(10) - triu(ones(10), 1)

Why do we know that B must be nonsingular? Set

C = inv(B) and x = C(:, 10)

Now change B slightly by setting B(10, 1) = -1/256. Use MATLAB to compute the product Bx. From the result of this computation, what can you conclude about the new matrix B? Is it nonsingular? Explain. Use MATLAB to compute its reduced now echelon form.

5. Generate a matrix A by setting

A = floor(10 * rand(6))

and generate a vector by setting

b = floor(20 * rand(6, 1)) - 10

(a) Since A was generated randomly, we would expect to be nonsingular. The system Ax = b should have a unique solution. Find the solution using the "\" operation. Use MATLAB to compute the reduced row echelon form U of [A b]. How does the last column of U compare with the solution x? In exact arithmetic they should be the same. Why? Explain. To compare the two, compute the difference U(:, 7) - x or examine both using format long.

(b) Let us now change A so as to make it singular. Set

A(:, 3) = A(:, 1 : 2) * [4 3]'

Use MATLAB to compute rref([A b]). How many solutions will the system Ax = b have? Explain.

(c) Set

y = floor(20 * rand(6, 1)) - 10 and c = A * y

Why do we know the system Ax = c must be consistent? Explain. Compute the reduced row echelong form U of [A c]. How many solutions does the system Ax = c have? Explain.

(d) The free variable determined by the echelon form should be x3. By examining the system corresponding to the matrix U, you should be able to determine the solution corresponding to x3 = 0. Enter this solution in MATLAB as a column vector w. To check that Aw = c, compute the residual vector c - Aw.

(e) Set U(:, 7) = zeros(6, 1). The matrix U should now correspond to the reduced row echelon form of (A | 0). Use U to determine  the solution to the homogeneous system when the free variable x3 = 1 (do this by hand) and enter the result as a vector z. Check your answer by computing A * z.

(f) Set v = w + 3 * z. The vector v should be a solution to the system Ax = c. Why? Explain. Verify that v is a solution by using MATLAB to compute the residual vector c - Av. What is the value of the free variable x3 for this solution? How could we determine all possible solutions to the system in terms of the vectors w and z? Explain.

6. Consider the graph

![Figure 1](https://www.github.com/partloer/linear_algebra_with_applications/1_matrices_and_systems_of_equations/figure1.jpg)

(a) Determine the adjacency matrix A for the graph and enter it in MATLAB.

(b) Compute A^2 and determine the number of walks of length 2 from (i) V1 to V7, (ii) V4 to V8 (iii) V5 to V6, (iv) V8 to V3.

(c) Compute A^4, A^6, A^8 and answer the questions to part (b) for walks of length 4, 6, and 8. Make a conjecture as to when there will be no walks of even length from vertex Vi to vertiex Vj.

(d) Compute A^3, A^5, A^7 and answer the questions from part (b) for walks of length 3, 5, and 7. Does your conjecture from part (c) hold for walk of odd length? Explain. Make a conjecture as to whether there are any walks of length k from Vi to Vj based on whether i + j + k is odd or even.

(e) If we add the edges {V3, V6}, {V5, V8} to the graph, the adjacency matrix B for the new graph can be generated by setting B = A and then setting

B(3, 6) = 1, B(6, 3) = 1, B(5, 8) = 1, B(8, 5) = 1

Compute B^k, for k = 2, 3, 4, 5. Is your conjecture from part (d) still valid for the new graph?

(f) Add the edge {V6, V8} to the fiture and construct the adjacency matrix C for the resulting graph. Compute powers of C to determine whether your conjecture from part (d) will still hold for this new graph.

7. In Application 2 of section 3, the number of married and single women after 1 and 2 years were determined by computing the products AX and A^2X for the given matrices A and X. Use format long and enter these matrices in MATLAB. Compute A^k and A^kX for k = 5, 10, 15, 20. What is happening to A^k as k gets large? What is the long-run distribution of married and single women in the town?

8. The following table describes a seven-stage model for the life cycle of the loggerhead turtle.

**Table 1 Seven-Stage Model for Loggerhead Turtle Demographics**
Stage Number | Description (age in years) | Annual Survivorship | Eggs Laid per Year
---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------
1 | Eggs, hatchlings (<1) | 0.6747 | 0
2 | Small juveniles (1-7) | 0.7857 | 0
3 | Large juveniles (8 - 15) | 0.7857 | 0
4 | Subadults (16-21) | 0.7425 | 0
5 | Novice breeders (22) | 0.8091 | 127
6 | First-year remigrants (23) | 0.8091 | 4
7 | Mature breeders (24-54) | 0.8091 | 80

The corresponding Leslie matrix is given by

L = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 127, 4, 80], [0.6747, 0.7370, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0.0486, 0.6610, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0.0147, 0.6907, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0.0518, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8091, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.8091, 0.8089] ]

Suppose that the number of turtles in each stage of the intial turtle population is described by the vector x0 = (200, 000 130, 000 100, 000 70, 000 500 400 1100)^T

(a) Enter L in MATLAB and then set x0 = (200000, 130000, 100000, 70000, 500, 400, 1100)'

Use the command x50 = round(L^50*x0)

to compute x50. Compute also the values of x100, x150, x200, x250, and x300.

(b) Loggerhead turtles lay their eggs on land. Suppose that conservationists take special measures to protect these eggs and as a result the survival rate for eggs and hatchlings inceases to 77 percent. To incorporate this change into our model, we need only change (2, 1) entry of L to 0.77. Make this modification to the matrix L and repeat part (a). Has the survival potential of the loggerhead turtle improved significantly?

(c) Suppose that instead of improving the survival rate for eggs and hatchlings we could devise a means of protecting the small juveniles so that their survival rate increases to 88 percent. Use equations (7) and (8) fro Application 3 of Section 3 to determine the proportion of small juveniles that survive and remain in the same stage and the proportion that survive and grow to the next stage. Modify your original matrix L accordingly and repeat part (a) using the new matrix. Has the survival potential of the loggerhead turtle improved significanlty?

9. Set

b = [ 8 -8 -8 8 8 -8 -8 8]';

and consider the system Ax = b. This system should be consistent. Verify that it is by computing U = rref([A b]). We should be able to find a solution for any choice of the five free variables. Indeed, set x2 = floor(10 * rand(5, 1)). If x2 represents the last five coordinates of a solution to the system, then we should be able to determine x1 = (x1, x2, x3)^T in terms of x2. To do this, set U = rref([A b]). The nonzero rows of U correspond to a linear system with block form

(I V)(x1) 
     (x2) = c

To solve equation, set V = U(1: 3, 4: 8), c = U(1 : 3, 9)

and use MATLAB to compute x1 in terms of x2, c, and V. Set x  [x1; x2] and verify that x is a solution to the system.
